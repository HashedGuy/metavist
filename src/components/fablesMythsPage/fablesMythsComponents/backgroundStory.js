           There was a time when planet Earth and its realms were in perfect balance. Humans were in tune with their environment in the physical realm. Legends were praised by their trustworthy followers and new myths were created to honor them in the mythical realm. The order between realms was kept, and life had profound meaning on every level. It was all in place, like it was meant to be.
        <br/><br/>
        But the first signs of corruption started to show soon after humans discovered fire. It was obvious that this volatile, yet extraordinary species was holding some kind of key that opens the doors to other realms. Stuck between godliness and fear, human minds were always easy to manipulate, yet it was in their hearts where the real battle was taking hold. And in what seemed to be just a blink of time, the face of Earth was changed forever.
        <br/><br/>
        Wars, famine, injustice and hatred began to dominate the physical realm. The corruption had a devastating effect on Earth’s biomes, because once humans lost their hearts - their minds quickly followed. Lands were ravaged and exploited beyond reason. The ecological viability of the whole planet swerved toward the edge of a precipice. Corruption was slowly spreading to the hybrid realm through unique hotspots connecting the Earth’s realms. As above, so below.
        <br/><br/>
        The destructive side of human nature was present since the dawn of time, which is why the wisest of people used to seek guidance from powerful mythical Legends in the hybrid realm. But even with their support, the most respected and enlightened spiritual leaders on Earth were losing the fight against the mystical force that captured and corrupted so many human hearts.
        <br/><br/>
        The Prime Council of the hybrid realm was urged to react when their hotspots stopped regenerating. Coral reefs, rainforests and hot springs were dying like a mirrored image of global annihilation in the human realm. In order to stop the source of dangerous corruption, the Prime Council chose three leaders of the biggest hybrid tribes to travel to the physical realm and investigate. These three mythical legends – Bigfoot, Thunderbird and Nessie – went on their way to face the unknown.   
        <br/><br/>
        Using unique hotspots to travel to the physical realm, the legends searched for the cause of destruction, only to discover that corruption has taken over hearts of human leaders, influencers and other people in power. Global mismanagement of resources and nonprofit corruption were just consequences of total absence of philanthropic values. Corrupted hearts were waging war against the whole human species. The trail of decay led to a government building taken over by a mysterious villain – The Whisperer.
        What The Whisperer has done to trap millions of human hearts was yet to be disclosed, but his manipulation was already tearing down the foundations of society in the physical realm. Once the Legends returned to the mythical realm, it was their duty to pick three promising warriors, one from each of their tribes. These hybrid heroes were then sent back to confront The Whisperer and bring the era of corruption to an end. But even their hybrid hearts, or at least traces of humanity left in them, could be susceptible to his fraudulence.
