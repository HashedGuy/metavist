                Remember a time where you wanted to donate to something? Whether it be to help those in need or maybe support a cause you feel strongly about. You most likely felt proud that your money was going towards a good cause, but there is always that feeling of what is my money going towards exactly?

                That is the exact situation Elon Musk found himself in when he claimed on Twitter he would give the United Nations World Food Programme six billion US Dollars to solve world hunger. Elon wanted nothing more than to know that his money was secure and going into exactly what he was donating towards. He asked for nothing more than to feel valued and be given the transparency he deserved.

                Why are we, the working class, donating a sum of five hundred billion annually subjected to the rigorous game that is the current state of nonprofits.
